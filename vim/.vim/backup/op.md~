want: if M \not in PSD, find a validation constraint

##  separation orable  -==== min eightvalue problem 
find y $y^T M y < 0  === one fo the eighvalue is negative 

# Semidefinite Programming 

 - optimize on PSD_m
 - min C\cdot M
 s.t  A_1 M \geq b_i
 A_m M \geq b_m
 M \in PSD


 can be solved effiently ? Poly time m,n
 Lineaer min C^T X \geq b_i
 s.t a_i



 Vector formulation 
 M  \in PSd
 claim s,t M_{ij} = <v_i, v_j>

 cholesky decomposition 
 M = U [\almabda matrix] U^T
 U D^(1/2) D^(-1/2)^T U^T = V V^T

 comparing to ILP rpgblems, 
 variables are vectors, constraints involve dot productive

 MAX -CUT
 maximize go across

 max _{x_i \in {-1,1,}}
 
 vector relazrion 

 unit vector 
 <v_i,v_j> = 1
 max 1/4\sum (v_i,v_j)^2  all in do product form .


example 2 
independent set 

x_i \in {0,1}

intended solution 
v_i is  0 verctor or e_i
start off a tough relatition , make it a better and narrow constrains

<v_i,v_i> + <v_j, v_j> \leq 1
    ==.
<v_i,v_j> = 0

loviasy theta relations 


Rounding algorigrtm for MAC_CUT
SDP relaxiation 
opt sdp.
Gaol : edges \geq opt_sdp(0.898)
    
relation -> rounding 
partition into two
