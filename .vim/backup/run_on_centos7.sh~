# Pay Attention to the following point.
# 1. As the program will generate plot using X-forwading to display the graph in your desktop,and importantly from which you use 'ssh -X compute1.eng.utah.edu'
# 2. As the program using BLAS, which is not easily supported in Centos 7, but it works fine on Centos 6.5, which is compute[1-3].eng.utah.edu. So please run my program in the above machine.
# 3. This program will finish all 1,2,3,4 experiments sequently by just the
# following command    



# data0 and data1 folder.
# I don't support to change the folder by arguments, as the experiment 3 and 4
# are highly reuseable for "data*" pattern. So I just hardcode the path "table2" "data0"
# "data1" in the code. Hence,
#./Perceptron
#├── build.sbt
#├── data0
#├── data1
#├── images
#├── project
#├── run.sh
#├── src
#├── table2
#└── target
# `sbt "run 0"` will compile and run the program. 
# case 2 => println("it will generate plot, and show the graph in X11")

# from cade machine to your machine, it will generate the plot but without
# visibility")
# case 0 => println("For running program in shell without X11, 
# you can use this one for no plot at all.")
# By default, it will not gengerate graphs in ssh remote model.

# when run.sh as 'sbt run 0', it will not generate graphs.
# You can use ssh -X login, and use `sbt run 2` to enjoy all the graphs.
