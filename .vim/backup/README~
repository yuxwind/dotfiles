# Know issues
1. Padding Option 
Only when the 'pad_left' is True, 'pad_right' is False, the answer will be the same with the example.<code>ngrams = NGrams(2,True,False,None,'\n')Â¬</code>

Because this is related with the pading when caculating bigram.

By setting the NGrams class with different padding options, we can get different answer .

2. Generate Sentence
As the sentence are generated only by the probilities of bigram, not considering the
part-of-speech things. Hence bigrams with limited context info cannot grantee the correctness of every
setence.
